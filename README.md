# filepicker_windows

File picker for Windows, using the common item dialog.

You'll find a Flutter example in the `example\flutter` folder, and some Dart
examples in the `example\dart` folder.

Built with the latest `master` channel of Flutter; will not work on
more stable channels until Windows support reaches beta.
